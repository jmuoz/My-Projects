Assignment 3: The third programming assignment for my Applied Machine Learning class. Students were expected to make a
K-nearest neighbors algorithm from scratch using a functional programming style. They then were tasked with attempting
to create a predictive model on churn data. This assignment took place over a week.

Challenge 3: The third challenge (larger assignment) in my Foundations for Data Science class.  sSudents were expected 
to write a naive bayes classifier from scratch and use it on a large SQLite database to predict the cause of forest fires.

Eaglefest: Eaglefest contains a python notebook which contains exploratory and descriptive analysis of safety data 
provided to my University by AECOM. Students had around 48 hours over a weekend to deliver insights on the data and
present their findings. The data itself may not be released, and has been deleted from my machine.
